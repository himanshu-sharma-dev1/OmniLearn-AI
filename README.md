## üöÄ Getting Started

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Local Development Setup</strong></summary>

**Backend Setup:**

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd intelli-tutor/backend

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Set up environment variables
# Create a .env file in the 'backend' directory:
touch .env

# Add your Google Gemini API key and the local frontend URL to the .env file:
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" >> .env
echo "FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173" >> .env

# 5. Apply database migrations
flask db upgrade

# 6. Run the backend server
flask run
# The backend will be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

**Frontend Setup:**

```bash
# Open a new terminal window
cd intelli-tutor/frontend

# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Run the frontend development server
npm run dev
# The frontend will be running on http://localhost:5173
```
</details>

<summary><strong>2. Production Environment with Docker</strong></summary>

This is the recommended way to run the application, as it mirrors a real-world production setup.

**Setup:**

1.  **Clone the repository** as shown above.
2.  **Create the backend `.env` file:** Navigate to `intelli-tutor/backend` and create a `.env` file.
3.  **Add your API Key:** Add `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here` to the `.env` file. The `FRONTEND_URL` is not needed here, as it will be handled automatically by Docker's networking.

**Running the Application:**

```bash
# Navigate to the root of the project directory (intelli-tutor)
cd ..

# Build and start all services in detached mode
docker-compose up --build -d
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

**Useful Docker Commands:**
*   **View Logs:** `docker-compose logs -f`
*   **Stop Services:** `docker-compose down`
*   **Stop and Remove Volumes (Deletes all data):** `docker-compose down -v`
